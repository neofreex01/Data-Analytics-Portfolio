## R(2019-2020) 
 This folder contains the project and paper I did/replicated during the UBC Econ graduate program. It displays how to estimate treatment effect, explain the result of randomization experiment (akin to  A/B test) and identify causality using statistical models with industry/domain knowledge. It could be referred as the ability to applying statistical models to the industry and how the analysis results would be conveyed.
