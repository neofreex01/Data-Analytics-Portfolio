## R(2019-2020) 
 Basically, this folder contains the project and paper I did/replicated during the UBC Econ graduate program. It displays my skill on how to estimate treatment effect, explain the result of randomization experiment (akin to  A/B test) and identify causality using statistical models with industry/domain knowledge. Also, these projects somehow shows how I convey the analysis results through table and figures.
